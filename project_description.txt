Environmental Impact Analyzer: A Step-by-Step Development Plan
This document outlines the procedure to develop a high-standard "Environmental Impact Analyzer"
web application. It includes technology suggestions (emphasizing Python and free resources) and
discusses the recommended development approach.
I. Refined Scope & Conceptualization
1.​ Initial Product Categories (Narrow Focus):
○​ Recommendation: Start with a very specific category to manage data complexity.
Examples:
1.​ "Apparel: Cotton T-Shirts"
2.​ "Beverages: Aluminum Canned Drinks"
3.​ "Electronics: Smartphones" (more complex due to component variety)
○​ Rationale: A narrow focus allows for deeper, more accurate data collection and
model refinement for that category before expanding.
2.​ Target Audience:
○​ Initial Focus: Individual Consumers. This simplifies the UI/UX and the type of
insights provided.
○​ Future Expansion: Businesses (requiring more detailed supply chain data, bulk
analysis, reporting features).
3.​ Key Environmental Impact Factors & Scoring:
○​ Identify 3-5 core, measurable factors for your initial score. Examples:
1.​ Carbon Footprint (CO2e): Manufacturing, transport.
2.​ Water Usage: Raw material cultivation, manufacturing.
3.​ Material Sustainability: Recycled content, recyclability, biodegradability,
source of raw materials (e.g., organic, FSC certified).
4.​ Chemical Usage/Pollution: Known hazardous substances used or released.
5.​ Waste Generation: Manufacturing waste, packaging waste.
○​ Scoring Concept: Aim for a simple, understandable overall "Eco-Score" (e.g., A-E,
1-100). This score should be a weighted aggregation of the individual factors. The
breakdown of how the score is derived must be transparent to the user.
4.​ Data Sources Strategy:
○​ Prioritize:
1.​ Open Public Databases: (e.g., Open Food Facts for food, industry-specific
public datasets if available).
2.​ Reputable NGO/Research Databases: Data from environmental
organizations or academic LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) databases (look for
free or summary data).
3.​ Manufacturer-Provided Data (with caution): If companies publish
sustainability reports or product details (verify and cross-reference).
4.​ Web Scraping (Ethically): Publicly available information from retail or brand
websites. Always respect robots.txt and Terms of Service. Do not overload
servers.

○​ Data Points to Collect: Product name, brand, materials, manufacturing
country/region, weight, packaging type, certifications (e.g., Fair Trade, Organic,
Cradle to Cradle).
5.​ Core Goals & User Value Proposition:
○​ Accuracy: Strive for the most accurate assessments possible with available data.
Acknowledge data limitations.
○​ Understandability: Present complex information in an easy-to-digest format.
○​ Actionable Insights: Help users make informed choices. Suggest more sustainable
alternatives if possible.
II. Technology Stack (Free & Python-Centric)
Your proposal lists good options. Here are suggestions focusing on free tiers/open-source and
Python for the backend:
●​ Frontend:
○​ Framework: React.js (using Vite for a fast build setup) or Vue.js. Both are powerful,
popular, and have large communities.
○​ Styling: Tailwind CSS. A utility-first CSS framework that is highly customizable and
efficient.
○​ State Management (for React): Zustand (simple) or React's built-in Context API
(for less complex state).
●​ Backend:
○​ Language & Framework: Python with FastAPI.
■​ FastAPI: Modern, high-performance, easy to learn, built-in data validation
(Pydantic), automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc).
Excellent for building RESTful APIs.
■​ Alternative: Flask is simpler for very small projects, but FastAPI's features
often save time in the long run.
■​ Free Resource: Official FastAPI documentation, numerous online tutorials.
○​ Database: PostgreSQL.
■​ Powerful, open-source, relational database. Handles complex queries well.
■​ Free Hosting: ElephantSQL (free tier), Supabase (provides PostgreSQL with a
generous free tier), or run locally with Docker.
■​ Alternative: MongoDB (NoSQL) if your product data is highly unstructured and
varies greatly. MongoDB Atlas offers a free tier.
●​ AI Models & Libraries (Python):
○​ NLP for Information Extraction:
■​ Hugging Face Transformers library: Access to thousands of pre-trained
models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) for tasks like Named Entity
Recognition (NER) to extract materials, locations, brands, etc., from text.
■​ spaCy: Another excellent NLP library, very efficient for production use, good
for NER and text processing.
○​ Machine Learning for Scoring (if applicable):
■​ Scikit-learn: Comprehensive library for classical machine learning algorithms
(regression, classification) if you build a predictive scoring model.

○​ Deep Learning (if needed later): PyTorch or TensorFlow (more complex, likely not
for V1 scoring).
●​ Data Collection & Preprocessing (Python):
○​ Web Scraping:
■​ Requests: For making HTTP requests.
■​ BeautifulSoup4: For parsing HTML and XML.
■​ Scrapy: A more powerful framework for complex scraping projects (has a
steeper learning curve).
○​ Data Manipulation: Pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
●​ Development & Deployment Tools:
○​ IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with Python and JavaScript extensions.
○​ Version Control: Git and GitHub (free for publicrepositories) or GitLab.
○​ Containerization: Docker to package your application for consistent deployment.
○​ API Testing: Postman (free versions).
III. Development Approach: Workflow-Based AI
For a project like this, a Workflow-Based AI approach is more practical and manageable initially
than a fully Agentic AI.
●​ Workflow-Based AI:
○​ You define a clear, step-by-step process that the system follows to generate an
assessment.
○​ Example Workflow:
1.​ User inputs product details (name, barcode, or description).
2.​ Backend receives input.
3.​ System queries its internal database for the product.
4.​ If not found, or data is incomplete, trigger data collection modules:
■​ Query pre-defined public APIs.
■​ If necessary, perform targeted web scraping (based on rules, e.g.,
search specific retail sites for the product).
5.​ Collected text data (descriptions, specs) is processed by NLP models
(Hugging Face/spaCy) to extract key features (materials, origin, certifications).
6.​ Extracted features and other data points are fed into the "Environmental
Impact Scoring Model." This model could be:
■​ A rule-based system: Assign scores/weights to different attributes
(e.g., "organic cotton: +5", "air freight: -10").
■​ A classical ML model (e.g., regression model trained on Scikit-learn) if
you can create a labeled dataset of products with known impact scores.
7.​ The final score and its breakdown are calculated.
8.​ Results are sent to the frontend for display.
○​ Advantages: More predictable, easier to debug, more control over the process and
data sources. The "AI" components are specific models (NLP, ML scorer) within this
defined workflow.
●​ Agentic AI (More Advanced, Future Consideration):

○​ An agent would have more autonomy to decide how to gather information and what
steps to take, potentially learning and adapting its strategies. This is significantly
more complex to build, train, and ensure reliability and safety (e.g., avoiding
misinformation, getting stuck in loops).
○​ Recommendation: Start with the workflow approach. You can incorporate more
"intelligent" decision-making into parts of your workflow over time, making it
incrementally more "agent-like" if beneficial.
IV. Detailed Implementation Steps
Here's a phased, step-by-step procedure:
Phase 1: Foundation & Data Acquisition (Months 1-3)
1.​ Step 1: Project Setup & Initial Design (Weeks 1-2)
○​ Set up Git repository (GitHub/GitLab).
○​ Establish development environments (Python, Node.js for frontend build tools, VS
Code).
○​ Create basic project structures for backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React/Vue).
○​ Design initial database schema in PostgreSQL (for products, materials, impact
factors, assessments).
○​ Create low-fidelity wireframes for the main user flows (product input, results display).
Tools:Penpot (open-source).
2.​ Step 2: Core Backend API Shell (Weeks 2-4)
○​ Develop basic FastAPI endpoints:
■​ POST /api/v1/assess: Placeholder to receive product info and return a dummy
assessment.
■​ GET /api/v1/products/{product_id}: Placeholder to fetch product data.
○​ Set up database connection and basic ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy with Alembic for
migrations, or SQLModel for FastAPI).
3.​ Step 3: Data Source Identification & Prioritization (Weeks 3-6)
○​ Deep dive into identifying specific, reliable, and free/accessible data sources for your
chosen initial product category.
○​ Document URLs, API endpoints (if any), data formats, and access methods.
○​ Assess the quality and coverage of these sources.
4.​ Step 4: Initial Data Collection Scripts (Weeks 5-10)
○​ Develop Python scripts (Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy if needed) to fetch data
from 1-2 key sources.
○​ Focus on collecting raw product information (names, descriptions, materials
mentioned, brand).
○​ Store this raw data (e.g., in JSON files or a staging table in PostgreSQL).
5.​ Step 5: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning (Weeks 8-12)
○​ Develop Python scripts (using Pandas) to:
■​ Clean the collected raw data (handle missing values, remove HTML,
standardize text).
■​ Normalize units (e.g., convert all weights to kilograms).

■​ Structure the data for storage in your main product database.
○​ Populate your PostgreSQL database with this initial cleaned dataset.
Phase 2: AI Model Development & Backend Logic (Months 3-6)
6.​ Step 6: NLP for Information Extraction (Weeks 10-16)
○​ Goal: Extract structured information (materials, manufacturing locations,
certifications) from unstructured product descriptions.
○​ Process:
■​ Select a pre-trained NER model from Hugging Face (e.g., dslim/bert-base-NER
for general entities, or fine-tune one if you have specific needs and data). Or
use spaCy's NER capabilities.
■​ Develop Python functions to take product descriptions as input and output
extracted entities.
■​ Experiment and iterate: You may need to fine-tune models or combine them
with rule-based approaches (regex) for better accuracy on your specific
product category.
■​ Store these extracted, structured features in your database, linked to products.
7.​ Step 7: Environmental Impact Scoring Logic - V1 (Rule-Based) (Weeks 14-20)
○​ Research: Gather data for impact factors. This is challenging. Look for:
■​ Average LCA data for common materials (e.g., CO2 per kg of cotton, PET
plastic).
■​ Impact of transportation modes (shipping vs. air freight).
■​ Effect of certifications (e.g., organic farming reduces pesticide impact).
○​ Develop a Python module:
■​ Define rules and weights for each factor. Example:
■​ score = (material_score * weight_material) + (transport_score * weight_transport)
+ ...
■​ material_score could be based on a lookup table (e.g., recycled

aluminum: +10, virgin aluminum: +2).
■​ This module will take the NLP-extracted features and other product data as
input.
○​ This first version will be an approximation. Transparency about assumptions is key.
8.​ Step 8: Integrate NLP & Scoring into Backend API (Weeks 18-24)
○​ Update the /api/v1/assess endpoint:
■​ It should now orchestrate the full flow: receive input -> fetch/augment data ->
run NLP -> run scoring model -> return detailed assessment (overall score +
breakdown).
○​ Implement caching (e.g., using fastapi-cache with Redis or an in-memory backend) to
store results for previously assessed products to speed up responses.
○​ Develop administrative endpoints if needed to manage data.
Phase 3: Frontend Development & User Experience (Months 5-8)
9.​ Step 9: Build Core Frontend UI (Weeks 20-28)

○​ Using React/Vue and Tailwind CSS, develop components for:
■​ Input: Search bar (product name/UPC), manual input form for key details.
■​ Results Display: Clear presentation of the overall Eco-Score, graphical
breakdown of contributing factors (e.g., bar charts, pie charts), and any
assumptions made.
■​ Product Comparison (Basic): Allow viewing 2-3 products side-by-side.
○​ Connect frontend to backend APIs.
○​ Ensure a responsive design (mobile-first approach).
10.​Step 10: User Feedback Mechanism (Weeks 26-30)
○​ Implement a simple way for users to provide feedback on the accuracy of an
assessment or suggest missing data.
○​ Create a backend endpoint (POST /api/v1/feedback) to store this.
11.​Step 11: Basic User Accounts (Optional for V1, but plan) (Weeks 28-32)
○​ If desired, integrate a simple authentication system.
■​ Free Resource: Supabase (includes auth), Firebase Authentication (generous
free tier), or roll your own with FastAPI (more work).
○​ Allows users to save past assessments or preferences.
Phase 4: Testing, Deployment, and Iteration (Months 8-9+)
12.​Step 12: Comprehensive Testing (Weeks 30-36)
○​ Backend Unit Tests: Use pytest for FastAPI endpoints, NLP functions, scoring logic.
○​ Frontend Unit/Component Tests: Use Jest/Vitest and React Testing Library/Vue
Test Utils.
○​ Integration Tests: Test the full flow from frontend input to backend processing and
frontend display.
○​ Usability Testing: Recruit a few potential users to try the application and provide
feedback on ease of use and clarity.
○​ Data Accuracy Testing: Manually verify a subset of product assessments against
any available benchmarks or expert knowledge. This is critical for credibility.
13.​Step 13: Deployment Strategy & Setup (Weeks 35-38)
○​ Containerize: Create Dockerfile for your FastAPI backend and a separate one if
needed for your frontend build process.
○​ Choose Hosting (Free Tiers):
■​ Backend (FastAPI): Fly.io, Railway.app, Heroku (free tier limitations),
PythonAnywhere. Google Cloud Run (has a free tier).
■​ Frontend (Static React/Vue build): Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages.
■​ Database (PostgreSQL): ElephantSQL, Supabase, Railway.app, or free tiers
on AWS RDS/Google Cloud SQL.
○​ CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions (free for public repos, generous free minutes for
private) to automate testing and deployment on pushes to your main branch.
14.​Step 14: Monitoring, Logging & Soft Launch (Week 37+)
○​ Implement structured logging in your FastAPI application (Python's logging module,
outputting JSON).
○​ Set up basic uptime monitoring (e.g., UptimeRobot - free plan).

○​ Consider a simple analytics tool (e.g., Plausible Analytics - has a free self-hosted
option, or GoatCounter - free for non-commercial).
○​ Soft launch to a limited audience to gather initial feedback.
15.​Step 15: Iterate and Improve (Ongoing)
○​ Collect and analyze user feedback.
○​ Continuously work on improving data source quality and coverage.
○​ Refine NLP models and the scoring algorithm. Add more factors.
○​ Consider training a custom ML model for scoring if you can gather sufficient labeled
data.
○​ Expand to new product categories.
○​ Fix bugs and enhance performance.
